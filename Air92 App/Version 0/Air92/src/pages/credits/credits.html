  <h1>Project D Polluted</h1>
  <h2>What this project is about:</h2>
  <p>The project is to allow people to see how much pollution people are come into contact with their daily commutes to and
    from work or other journeys. The reasoning behind this project to is ensure people are aware of the effects of pollution
    as people don't pay as much attention to negative effects. To achieve this a Raspberry Pi and sensors will be used collect
    the data and store the pollution data in a server. This data will allow show the amount of pollution around different
    parts of Manchester when people go on their daily commute to and from work or other journeys. They will record this data
    using the Raspberry Pi with the sensors connected to an app which they will use to interact with the Pi in order to collect
    the data so it will be a simple method which most non-technical people will be able to use to gather data.
